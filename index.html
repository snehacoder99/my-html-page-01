            <li>01The term 'robot' comes from the Czech word 'Robota', that means 'Drudgery' or 'hard work' and 'forced labor'.
                02George Devol invented the first digital operated robot.
                03A robot is a machine that is designed to do tasks without the help of a person.
                04Robots only do what they are programmed.</li>
